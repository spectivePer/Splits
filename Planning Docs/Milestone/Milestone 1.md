### UI Designs
These designs do not need to be pixel perfect, and in fact they shouldn't be. 
Use a whiteboard and take pictures, or better yet use a tool like Balsamiq that lets you draw sketch / wireframe designs easily.

### Testing Plan
A good app should get feedback from potential users early and often. 
List here what you plan to get other people to test out. Having your friends or classmates from other groups help you with testing is acceptable (and encouraged). 
You should have at least one aspect that you measure with each test. 
Measurements can be quantitative (e.g., how long does it take for them to signup for a new account) or based on survey data 
(e.g., answers to "from a scale of 1-5 how easy was it to signup?")
