# Checklist
### UI Designs
These designs do not need to be pixel perfect, and in fact they shouldn't be. 
Use a whiteboard and take pictures, or better yet use a tool like Balsamiq that lets you draw sketch / wireframe designs easily.


### Third Party Libraries
Server support for your app. If you plan to roll your own server support, a full listing of the APIs you plan to build


### Models
A listing of all of the models you plan to include in your app

### View Controllers
- Please include how you plan to navigate to / from each ViewController and any protocols / delegates / variables you plan to use for ViewController / 
   ViewController communication
   
- Launch, login, verification, home, settings, add split, scan receipt, history, purchase summary


### Project Timeline
A list of approximately week long tasks and a timeline of when each of them will be done


### Trello Board
A trello board that includes all of the tasks and their state (up next, in progress, blocked, done). 
These tasks need to include an owner from the start, but the owner can change during the quarter as needed


### Testing Plan
A good app should get feedback from potential users early and often. 
List here what you plan to get other people to test out. Having your friends or classmates from other groups help you with testing is acceptable (and encouraged). 
You should have at least one aspect that you measure with each test. 
Measurements can be quantitative (e.g., how long does it take for them to signup for a new account) or based on survey data 
(e.g., answers to "from a scale of 1-5 how easy was it to signup?")
