## UI Designs
These designs do not need to be pixel perfect, and in fact they shouldn't be. 
Use a whiteboard and take pictures, or better yet use a tool like Balsamiq that lets you draw sketch / wireframe designs easily.

## Testing Plan
We plan to have three testing phases using Google Forms.

### Phase 1
The first testing phase was already implemented when we reached out to friends and family, asking if they would use our app if we created it.
From the feedback, there were a few concerns.
The first concern was that there were already many apps in the app store.
After consulting Dr. King, we are going to focus on improving the UI as well as focusing on how to make the split between bills really good in order to distinguish between other apps. 
We also believe providing the OCR feature for free will help gain attractive users.
The second concern was people didn't want to have to an app just to perform calculations and then have to open another app to pay another person.
We are going to implement direct payment within our app to address this issue.
However, implementing direct payment doesn't address the problem that many people don't use a bill splitting app because they simply can estimate how much they owe and Venmo the other person. 

### Phase 2
Questions for the second phase.
- From a scale of 1-5 (1 being easy, 5 being hard), how easy was it to signup?
- From a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to create a new split by manually inputting a number?
- From a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to create a new split using OCR function?
- What additional features would you like to see in the app?
- Would you use this app? Y/N Why?

### Phase 3
Questions for the third phase.
- Would you use this app? Y/N Why?
