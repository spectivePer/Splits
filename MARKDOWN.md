# ECS189E Splits
## Summary
Splits is an app that conveniently splits a bill, receipt, or payment among two or more people. 
Integration of OCR, flexibility between users who have the app installed and those who don't, as well 
as autosuggesting which items on a bill are personal or group use will be some key features of Splits. 
Automatic payments with companies such as Venmo, PayPal, Stripe, and ApplePay will be used for ease of use.
